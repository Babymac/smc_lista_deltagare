# Backend Readme

## Commands

- npm run dev

## Tech

- Express - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express

## File structure

* Service - files containing diffrent services like, 'mysql', 'XML creator', and alike.

* Server.js - this is the main file for the whole back end, and we will build from there on.

## Hosting, build

To host the frontend from the backend, simply use 'node server' to start the server. This will host the frontend app on localhost:8080.

When your ready to test your changes are working on the server hosting it, simply 'npm run build' and create-react-app builds a new build folder for you and hosts it at localhost:8080.

## App

The app runs nodemon on default on the 'npm start' command.
